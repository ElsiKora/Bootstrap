# Factory Pattern

The `Factory` pattern, implemented via `IFactory` and `BaseFactory`, provides a standardized way to create instances of objects based on named templates stored in a [`Registry`](../registry).

Instead of scattering `new MyObject(...)` calls throughout your code, you ask the factory to `create('objectName')`.
This centralizes creation logic and makes it easy to switch out implementations or configurations.

## Key Features & Examples

- **Creation (`create`)**: The core method. It takes a `name`, looks up the corresponding template object in its associated [`Registry`](../registry), clones it (by default using `structuredClone`), potentially transforms it, caches it, and returns the final instance.

  ```typescript filename="src/user-factory.ts"
  import { createFactory, createRegistry, type IFactory, type IRegistry } from '@elsikora/cladi';

  // Define user profile structure
  interface UserProfile {
    name: string; // Registry key
    userId: string;
    email: string;
    plan: 'free' | 'pro' | 'enterprise';
    features: string[];
  }

  // 1. Set up the Registry with templates
  const userRegistry: IRegistry<UserProfile> = createRegistry<UserProfile>({});
  userRegistry.register({ 
    name: "free-user", 
    userId: `user-${Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 9)}`, 
    email: "", 
    plan: "free", 
    features: ["basic-support"]
  });
  userRegistry.register({ 
    name: "pro-user", 
    userId: `user-${Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 9)}`, 
    email: "", 
    plan: "pro", 
    features: ["priority-support", "advanced-reporting"]
  });

  // 2. Create the Factory linked to the Registry
  const userFactory: IFactory<UserProfile> = createFactory<UserProfile>({ registry: userRegistry });

  // 3. Use the Factory to create instances
  const newUserFree = userFactory.create("free-user");
  newUserFree.email = "test1@example.com"; // Modify the instance

  const newUserPro = userFactory.create("pro-user");
  newUserPro.email = "test2@example.com";

  console.log(`Created Free User: ${newUserFree.userId}, Plan: ${newUserFree.plan}`);
  console.log(`Created Pro User: ${newUserPro.userId}, Plan: ${newUserPro.plan}`);

  // Creating another free user gets a *new instance* (due to cloning)
  const anotherFreeUser = userFactory.create("free-user");
  console.log(`Are the two free users the same object? ${newUserFree === anotherFreeUser}`); // false
  ```

- **Registry Association**: Each `Factory` instance is tightly coupled to a specific `IRegistry` instance provided during its creation (`IBaseFactoryOptions.registry`).

- **Cloning Behavior**: The `BaseFactory` uses `structuredClone` by default. This ensures that modifying a created instance does not affect the original template in the registry or subsequently created instances.

- **Optional Transformation (`transformer`)**: You can provide a function (`IBaseFactoryOptions.transformer`) that takes the template from the registry and returns a modified version *before* it's cached and cloned by the factory. This is useful for applying defaults, adding dynamic properties, or performing complex setup.

  ```typescript
  // ... registry setup as before ...

  // Assume userRegistry is declared and populated
  declare const userRegistry: IRegistry<UserProfile>;

  const transformingFactory = createFactory<UserProfile>({
    registry: userRegistry,
    transformer: (template) => {
      // Add a timestamp to every created user profile
      const transformed = structuredClone(template); // Clone to avoid modifying registry template
      (transformed as any).createdAt = new Date().toISOString();
      return transformed;
    }
  });

  const userWithTimestamp = transformingFactory.create("pro-user");
  console.log(userWithTimestamp);
  // Output includes: ..., createdAt: '2023-10-27T...' 
  ```

- **Caching (Internal)**: The `BaseFactory` caches the *first transformed template* for each name. Subsequent calls to `create` for the same name will `structuredClone` this cached template, avoiding repeated lookups and transformations.

- **Cache Clearing (`clearCache`)**: If the underlying [`Registry`](../registry) changes, you *must* call `factory.clearCache(name?)` to remove the factory's cached template(s) and force it to re-fetch (and re-transform) from the registry on the next `create` call. If `name` is omitted, the entire factory cache is cleared.

## Purpose & Use Cases

- **Decouple Object Creation**: Hides the complexity of creating objects (`new ...`, setting defaults, etc.) behind a simple `create(name)` interface.
- **Manage Instance Variations**: Easily create different pre-configured instances of the same base object type (like user profiles, database connections, API clients).
- **Enforce Consistency**: Ensures objects are created according to the defined templates in the registry.
- **Combine with DI**: Factories themselves can be registered in the [`Container`](../container) to provide on-demand creation of specific object types throughout the application.

## Core Implementation

- **`IFactory<T>` (Interface)**: Located in `src/domain/interface/factory.interface.ts`. Defines the `create` method and `getRegistry`.
- **`BaseFactory<T>` (Class)**: Located in `src/infrastructure/class/base/factory.class.ts`. The default implementation using an associated `Registry`, with template caching, cloning, and optional transformation.
- **`createFactory<T>` (Utility)**: Exported from the library root. A convenient function to instantiate `BaseFactory`, requiring `IBaseFactoryOptions` (which must include a `registry`).
