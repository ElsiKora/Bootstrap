# Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a powerful design pattern that provides a foundation for building loosely coupled, modular, and testable applications. ClaDI implements this pattern through a robust container system and decorators.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll explore:

- **[Introduction](./introduction)**: What dependency injection is, why it matters, and how it improves your code architecture
- **[Container](./container)**: The central registry for your application's dependencies
- **[Decorators](./decorators)**: Simplified dependency registration and injection using TypeScript decorators

## Key Benefits

Using ClaDI's dependency injection system provides several advantages:

- **Loose Coupling**: Components depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations
- **Enhanced Testability**: Easily swap real implementations with test doubles
- **Centralized Configuration**: Manage dependency creation and configuration in one place
- **Code Reusability**: Build more modular and maintainable components
- **Proper Separation of Concerns**: Each component focuses on its core responsibilities

## Looking Deeper

Dependency injection is at the heart of ClaDI's architecture. It enables many of the framework's other features and serves as a foundation for building complex applications with clean, maintainable code.
