# Welcome to ClaDI

**ClaDI** (pronounced "Clah-Dee" or like "Claddie") is a lightweight, TypeScript-first library providing core utilities for building structured and maintainable applications, focusing on Dependency Injection (DI) and related patterns.

It offers robust implementations for:

*   **Dependency Injection Container:** Manage your application's dependencies effectively.
*   **Registry Pattern:** Store and retrieve configurations or templates using symbols.
*   **Factory Pattern:** Create instances based on registered templates.
*   **Standardized Logging:** A simple console logger interface and implementation.
*   **Consistent Error Handling:** A base error class for structured error reporting.
