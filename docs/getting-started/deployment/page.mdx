# Deployment

This documentation site is built with [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), which uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) under the hood. Deploying it follows standard Next.js deployment procedures.

## Building the Site

Before deployment, you need to build the static assets.

1.  **Ensure Dependencies:** Make sure you have installed all project dependencies, including Nextra and its peers (`react`, `react-dom`, `next`).
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```
2.  **Build Command:** Run the standard Next.js build command. This typically generates an optimized production build in the `.next` directory.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    # or
    pnpm build
    ```
    *(This assumes you have a `build` script defined in your `package.json` like `"build": "next build"`)*

## Deployment Options

Once built, you have several options for deployment:

### 1. Static Export (Recommended for Simple Hosting)

If your site is purely static (no server-side logic needed by Nextra themes typically), you can export it as static HTML/CSS/JS files.

1.  **Add Export Script:** Add an `export` script to your `package.json`:
    ```json filename="package.json"
    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start",
        "export": "next build && next export" 
      }
    }
    ```
2.  **Configure `next.config.js` (Optional):** For static export, ensure you don't have conflicting configurations. You might need to disable image optimization features that require a server, or configure them for static export if your hosting supports it. Nextra's default theme is usually compatible with static export.
3.  **Run Export:**
    ```bash
    npm run export
    # or
    yarn export
    # or
    pnpm export
    ```
    This will generate the static site in the `out` directory by default.
4.  **Deploy:** Deploy the contents of the `out` directory to any static web hosting provider like:
    *   [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
    *   [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
    *   [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
    *   AWS S3/CloudFront
    *   Firebase Hosting
    *   etc.

### 2. Next.js Hosting (Vercel, Netlify, Node.js Server)

You can also deploy the site as a standard Next.js application.

1.  **Build:** Run `npm run build` (or equivalent).
2.  **Deploy:**
    *   **Vercel/Netlify:** These platforms have built-in support for Next.js. Connect your Git repository, and they will typically detect it's a Next.js project, build it, and deploy it automatically.
    *   **Node.js Server:** You can run the built application using `npm run start` (or `yarn start`, `pnpm start`) on any Node.js hosting environment (like AWS EC2, Google Cloud Run, Heroku, DigitalOcean Apps).

Choose the deployment method that best suits your hosting infrastructure and needs. For most documentation sites built with Nextra, static export is often the simplest and most cost-effective option.
