# Utility Types

ClaDI exports a few utility types primarily used in interface definitions and function signatures.

## `TConstructor<T>`

Represents a general-purpose constructor function for a class that produces instances of type `T`. It accepts any number of arguments (`...args: any[]`).

<TSDoc code={`import type { TConstructor } from '@elsikora/cladi'; export default TConstructor`} />

**Usage:** Used in `IFactory`, `IRegistry`, and `IContainer` to refer to class constructors that can be registered or instantiated.

## `TContainerDynamicFactory<T>`

Represents a factory function specifically designed for use with the `IContainer`. This function is executed by the container the first time a dependency registered with this factory is requested.

<TSDoc code={`import type { TContainerDynamicFactory } from '@elsikora/cladi'; export default TContainerDynamicFactory`} />

-   It receives a `context` object (`IContainerDynamicFactoryResolutionContext`) containing the container instance itself, allowing the factory to resolve other dependencies if needed.
-   It must return an instance of type `T`.

**Usage:** Used in `IContainer` registration methods (`register`, `registerMany`) as an alternative to registering instances or `@Injectable` constructors.

## `IContainerDynamicFactoryResolutionContext`

The interface for the context object passed to a `TContainerDynamicFactory<T>` function during resolution.

<TSDoc code={`import type { IContainerDynamicFactoryResolutionContext } from '@elsikora/cladi'; export default IContainerDynamicFactoryResolutionContext`} />

-   `container`: Provides access to the `IContainer` instance performing the resolution, enabling the factory to call `container.get()` for its own internal dependencies.
