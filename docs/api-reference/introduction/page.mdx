# API Reference

This section provides a reference for the key exports, interfaces, types, and utilities available in the ClaDI library.

While the [Core Concepts](../core-concepts/introduction) section explains the patterns and usage in detail, this section focuses on the specific API signatures and types.

-   **[Key Exports](./key-exports):** The main functions and classes you'll import directly from `@elsikora/cladi`.
-   **[Core Interfaces](./core-interfaces):** Detailed look at the primary interfaces like `IContainer`, `IRegistry`, `IFactory`, `ILogger`, and `IError`.
-   **[Utility Types](./utility-types):** Reference for helper types like `TConstructor` and `TContainerDynamicFactory`.
-   **[Other Utilities](./other-utilities):** Documentation for standalone utility functions.
