# General Guide: Generating Nextra Documentation Paths for Other Projects

Based on common practices and analysis of projects like ClaDI, here's a comprehensive guide for structuring Nextra documentation:

1.  **Understand Your Source Structure (`src/` or equivalent):**
    *   How is your code organized? (e.g., by feature, by layer, by type?)
    *   Knowing this helps decide how *or if* you want to map it to docs.

2.  **Design Your Documentation Information Architecture (`docs/`):**
    *   **Think like a user:** How would someone *look* for information about your project? This often leads to a *conceptual* structure.
    *   **Common Top-Level Categories:**
        *   `getting-started/`
        *   `guides/` or `tutorials/`
        *   `concepts/` or `core-concepts/`
        *   `api-reference/`
        *   `deployment/`
        *   `examples/`
    *   **Sub-Categories:** Within these, group related topics.
        *   `guides/authentication.mdx`
        *   `guides/data-fetching.mdx`
        *   `api-reference/components/`
        *   `api-reference/hooks/`
        *   `api-reference/utils/`

3.  **Choose Your Documentation Generation Strategy:**

    *   **A) Fully Manual:**
        *   **Process:** Manually create every `.md` or `.mdx` file inside your `docs` structure.
        *   **Path Mapping:** *You* decide the mapping. `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` might become `docs/api-reference/components/button.mdx`. There's no automatic link; you create the `docs` file where it makes sense conceptually.
        *   **Pros:** Full control over content and structure. Ideal for guides, tutorials, conceptual explanations.
        *   **Cons:** Time-consuming for large APIs, requires manual updates when code changes.

    *   **B) Semi-Automated (Common):**
        *   **Process:**
            *   Manually write conceptual docs (guides, tutorials) like in (A).
            *   Use a tool (like TypeDoc, JSDoc, Sphinx, etc.) to *generate* API reference documentation from source code comments (e.g., JSDoc blocks, TSDoc).
        *   **Path Mapping (Generated Part):**
            *   Configure the generator tool to output files (often Markdown) into a specific part of your `docs` directory (e.g., `docs/generated-api/`).
            *   The generator determines the paths within `docs/generated-api/` based on your source structure and its own rules/configuration (e.g., `src/utils/format.ts` -> `docs/generated-api/modules/utils.md` or `docs/generated-api/functions/format.md`).
            *   You link to this generated section from your main `_meta.js`.
        *   **Pros:** Keeps API docs synced with code, saves time on documenting APIs. Manual control over guides.
        *   **Cons:** Requires setting up and configuring the generator tool. Need to write good source code comments.

    *   **C) Fully Automated:**
        *   **Process:** The generator tool creates *all* documentation content from source code comments.
        *   **Path Mapping:** Entirely determined by the generator tool based on source structure.
        *   **Pros:** Minimal manual effort if source comments are excellent.
        *   **Cons:** Often lacks narrative flow, tutorials, or conceptual explanations unless the generator is very sophisticated or comments are *extremely* detailed. Less common for comprehensive project docs.

4.  **Implement Navigation with `_meta.js` / `_meta.json`:**
    *   Place a `_meta` file in *each* directory within `docs` that needs items in the sidebar.
    *   Map the *filenames* (without extension) or *directory names* within that folder to the desired sidebar titles.
    *   The order of keys in the `_meta` file defines the sidebar order.
    *   Example (`docs/_meta.js`):
        ```javascript
        export default {
          "getting-started": "Getting Started", // Link to 'getting-started' dir/page
          "guides": "Usage Guides",          // Link to 'guides' dir/page
          "api-reference": "API Reference",    // Link to 'api-reference' dir/page
          "-- Community --": { "type": "separator", "title": "Community" }, // Separator
          "contributing": "Contributing",
          "github-link": { // External link
             "title": "GitHub â†—",
             "href": "https://github.com/your-repo",
             "newWindow": true
          }
        };
        ```
    *   Example (`docs/api-reference/_meta.js`):
        ```javascript
        export default {
          "introduction": "Overview", // api-reference/introduction.mdx
          "components": "Components", // api-reference/components/ directory
          "hooks": "Hooks",       // api-reference/hooks/ directory
          "utils": "Utilities"    // api-reference/utils/ directory
        };
        ```
    *   Consult the [Nextra `_meta` documentation](https://nextra.site/docs/directory-structure/meta-file) for all options (separators, external links, etc.).

5.  **Generating the Paths (Summary):**
    *   **Manual Docs:** The path is whatever you choose when creating the `.mdx` file within your `docs` structure (e.g., `docs/guides/my-feature.mdx`).
    *   **Generated Docs:** The path is determined by the generation tool's output configuration, relative to where you tell it to save the files (e.g., `docs/generated-api/`).
    *   **Navigation:** The `_meta.js` files *link* these file/directory paths to the user-visible sidebar structure.

By following these steps, you can create a clear, navigable, and maintainable documentation site using Nextra, choosing the automation level that best suits your project's needs. The key is often a conceptual `docs` structure combined with `_meta.js` for navigation, potentially integrating auto-generated API references.
